# TimeSeries-Seq2Seq-deepLSTMs-Keras
This project aims to give you an introduction to how Seq2Seq based encoder-decoder neural network architectures can be applied on time series data to make forecasts. The code is implemented in pyhton with Keras (Tensorflow backend). 

For a high level understanding of the project, do read my [blog post](https://medium.com/@Manohar029/time-series-forecasting-with-deep-stacked-unidirectional-and-bidirectional-lstms-de7c099bd918) on medium.com.
